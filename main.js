// Hey Jan. This is the first step in our collaborative effort. Much like ruby (I'm sure), we use JS to establish, store, manipulate, etc certain data types. 
// The primary ones you need to concern yourself with are: boolean, number, string (literally anything in quotes, bassically), null, and undefined
// We use variables to store values to these data types, like this 
var hairType = 'curly'
var isLong = true
var follicles = 145850

//We store multiple pieces of data in two complex types: array and object. Arrays are stored within [] and objects wihin {}, and are separated by commas.  Here's an array:

var hairStyles = ['bob', 'bald', 'perm', 'shaggy'] 
// each string (hair style) is separated by a comma, and is known as an element. Each element is assigned an index position from L-R starting with 0
//So this array has 4 elements, indices 0-3. 

//Here's an object: 

var residence = {
    bedrooms: 3,
    bathrooms: 2,
    isCozy: true,
    owner: 'The Boomers'
}
//Notice how, in our object, we have four pieces of data, known as properties, that are separated by commas. Each property has a key (L): and a value (R).
